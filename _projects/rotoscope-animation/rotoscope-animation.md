## Description

For this project, you will create a looping animation that is 1 minute length based on found reference footage. You will practice an animation technique called rotoscoping, where the original footage is traced to capture form, movement, and other attributes. It is only necessary to capture the gesture of the original footage with your animation, you do not need to capture the complex forms, colors, and textures present in the original footage. You can combine other animation and post-production techniques to give your work as much visual complexity as you like.

Some things you may be interested in creating as loops might include animal locomotion, memes, video footage you recorded, abstract shapes and colors, future/retro sci-fi scapes, etc.

## Requirements

1. Rotoscope "live action" video footage. Do not rotoscope animations or drawings.
2. Animation should loop seamlessly.
3. The loop should be 5-20 seconds in length.
4. The animation should repeat the loop for approximinately 1 minute (between 3-12 times depending on length of the loop).
5. Audio/sound is not required, but may be used. Use only audio that you have permission to use (Public domain, CC Licensed, etc.) or that you have created yourself.

## Submission Instructions

1. Watch relevant Lynda and Web tutorials
2. Create a project folder called **{{page.submission-id}}**
3. Find and download [reference video](https://vimeo.com/groups/aniref) with [https://savieo.com](https://savieo.com).
4. Create a project and a new composition in AfterEffects
    1. **Preset:** HDTV 1080 24 w/ Square Pixels
5. Import the video reference footage to the After Effects project bin.
7. Move the video to the timeline and begin to rotoscope using the footage as a guide. Use the time remapping tool to adjust length and speed of the video clip(s) to your liking before rotoscoping if desired.
8. Add sound and audio and sync with your animation if desired. Audio is optional.
9. Disable or remove the video footage layer and begin to adjust the composition, scale, effects, and looping keyframe animation.
9. When finished, export your composition using the Adobe Media Encoder: **File** → **Export** → **Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue**.
   1. Wait until the sequence appears in the queue. This may take a minute.
   2. In the queue, edit the export settings. 
   3. Choose **H.264** format from the format dropdown.
   4. Select the **Vimeo 1080p** preset from the dropdown.
   5. Click on the output file location and change it to point to your project folder.
   5. Press the Green Play button to render.
10. **Upload the video** to your vimeo.com account.
11. **Post a link** to vimeo on the project 3 canvas discussion.
12. Name your final animation as **_{{page.submission-id}}.mp4_** and **upload the file** to Canvas.
