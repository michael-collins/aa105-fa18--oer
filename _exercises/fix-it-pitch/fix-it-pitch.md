In the exercise, you will use the HMW question from the previous exercise, your field research, and the Brainwriting exercise conducted in class to create a **project pitch**. In the design world, this can be one of the most important documents that you will make, and so it's important that it is as well presented as possible.

## PDF Pitch Document
For this project, you will create a PDF document that has the following:

1. Name
2. Date
3. Title of your pitch ("How Might We?" Question)
4. Pitch
  - **Needs:** Which needs are you are addressing and for whom?
  - **Approach:** What is your unique approach to address these needs? This can be a concise sentence describing the approach. Use the Brainwriting sheet to help you identify an approach.
  - **Benefits:** What are the benefits of using this concept?
  - **Risks:** What could go wrong? Who might want to stop the project? Are there disadvantages?
  - **Resources:** What resources do you need to get the project completed?
5. Visual sketches of your idea
  - Any drawings should be scanned in so they are as presentable as possible.
  - If your solution is not an object, app, or tangible thing, you can draw diagrams or other visuals to help communicate your ideas.
6. Ideation
  - Scan in the [Brain Writing Canvas]({{ site.baseurl }}{{page.asset-path}}/brainwriting-canvas.pdf) and include at the end of the document

## Instructions
1. Complete the pitch document in MS Word, Google Docs, or other word processing or layout software. Please properly format this document using headings and subheadings.
