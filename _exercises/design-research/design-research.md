2. How Might We: http://www.designkit.org/methods/3

#### Developing a 'How Might We...' question

1. Use the following pattern for creating the sentence: How might we ( positive action ) ( a description of specific challenge ) ( a specific context ) ?
2. **Example:** How might we ( relieve the stress of social interaction from ) ( a person who has trouble feeling comfortable in groups ) ( when they socialize with friends )?

Keep a small notebook with you as you move through your day (I recommend [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft) or [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-grey/p0409)) and write down or sketch out anything that feels poorly designed, broken, non-functional, ill-considered, potentially harmful, or something that could be better. Remember to also record your own personal feelings, state of mind, physical limitations or conditions, and other information that can help desribe your experience and why it may have occured. 
   - Document these occurances with photos, short videos, sketches, diagrams, schematics, notes, and/or drawings.
