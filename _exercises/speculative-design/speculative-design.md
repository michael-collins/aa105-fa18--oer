In this exercise, you will observe your local designed environment. Keep a small notebook with you as you move through your day (I recommend [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft) or [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-grey/p0409)) and make a note of anything that feels poorly designed, broken, non-functional, ill-considered, potentially harmful, or something that could be better.
