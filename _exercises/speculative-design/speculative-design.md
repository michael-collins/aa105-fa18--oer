In this exercise, you will observe your local designed environment. Keep a small notebook with you as you move through your day (I recommend [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft) or [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-grey/p0409)) and make a note of anything that feels poorly designed, broken, non-functional, ill-considered, potentially harmful, or something that could be better.

## Learning Resources


## Instructions
1. Keep a small notebook with you as you move through your day (I recommend Field Notes or Moleskine) and make a note of any experience you observed or had that feels poorly designed, broken, non-functional, ill-considered, potentially harmful, or something that could be better in some way. Try to find as many of these instances as possible. 
2. Document these occurances with photos, short videos, sketches, diagrams, schematics, notes, and/or drawings.
3. Place your documentation into a folder.
7. Upload your do[submission dropbox]({{ site.assignments.[page.exercise].dropbox-url }})
8. Ensure you’ve included everything properly. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded the file will result in your exercise being graded according the grading criteria.
