In this exercise, you will perform field research, draw insights, and describe a problem in the form of a question.

## Instructions
1. Observe and make note of the local designed environment. Keep a small notebook with you as you move through your day (I recommend [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft) or [Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-grey/p0409)) and write down or sketch out anything that feels poorly designed, broken, non-functional, ill-considered, potentially harmful, or something that could be better. Remember to also record your own personal feelings, state of mind, physical limitations or conditions, and other information that can help desribe your negative experience and why it may have occured. 
2. Place your observation documentation into a **Research Folder**: Document your experiences from step 1 with photos, short videos, sketches, diagrams, schematics, notes, and/or drawings.
3. Choose **one** experience to focus on from your notes.
4. Look at the following design thinking exercises. Meet with your canvas group and work through these activities for each person's experience. Each person should come away with a set of insights and one HMW question: [Canvas groups]({{ page.groups-link }})
   - [Insights](http://www.designkit.org/methods/62)
   - [How Might We](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3)
5. **Doc**: In a MS word document named: `{{ page.submission-id }}.doc` Each person must have their own document.
   - Name
   - Date
   - Part 1. Insights
   - Part 2. How Might We question (Use the question formula privided)
6. Upload your **Research Folder** and **Doc** to [submission dropbox]({{ site.assignments.[page.exercise].dropbox-url }})
7. Ensure you’ve included everything properly. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded the file will result in your exercise being graded according the grading criteria.

## Learning Resources
